## Features

- Browse internal storage and mounted external volumes such as SD cards and USB/OTG media.
- Continue without broad storage access and use Storage Access Framework document trees or remote servers in limited mode.
- Switch among list, compact list, and grid layouts, view image, video-frame, first-page PDF, embedded Office preview, and readable local APK application-icon thumbnails, show hidden files, sort by name, size, date, or type, and search the current folder.
- Pull down to refresh list and grid listings, including empty folders and failed loads, while preserving valid selections.
- Browse Home categories for APKs, videos, audio, images and documents across mounted shared storage, with cancellable scanning and explicit coverage information.
- Find duplicate files in a local folder by content, choose copies to remove, and recheck a copy to keep before removal.
- Filter a folder by directories, images, videos, audio, documents, archives, or Android packages.
- Select visible results, share local or document-tree files, inspect file details, copy, move, rename, delete, and create files and folders, including cross-provider transfers with filenames, bytes, percentage, and speed.
- Keep file transfers running through Activity recreation and backgrounding, cancel supported transfers from the app or notification, and retain their final completed-item count.
- Resolve destination conflicts with Replace, Skip, or Cancel, including an apply-to-all choice and staged replacement that preserves the existing file until copying succeeds.
- Long-press and drag to select ranges across list and grid views, including scrolling at the edge of the screen.
- Create ZIP archives and safely extract ZIP, TAR, TGZ, TAR.GZ, TBZ2, TAR.BZ2, GZ, and BZ2 files on local, document-tree, or remote providers. RAR files are recognized and reported as unsupported.
- Open local and document-tree files through Android's registered handlers so Android's default-app choices are honored, or explicitly choose a handler with Open with. Writable local files receive temporary write permission so an external editor can save changes; Share grants read access only. APK files open in Android's package installer.
- Choose Trash or permanent deletion for each direct-local operation, restore recoverable per-volume Trash items, or disable Trash in Settings.
- Bookmark local folders, open common media locations, customize the visibility and order of Home sections, and keep several local, document-tree, or remote browser sessions open. The Sessions sheet in the browser switches between them and opens saved connections, bookmarks, or storage volumes in place, without returning Home.
- Pin a local folder to a supporting launcher’s Home screen, with destination and storage-access validation on launch.
- Set a local or document-tree audio file as the ringtone or notification tone after granting Android's system-settings permission.
- Automatically close inactive browser sessions after Voyager remains in the background for a chosen duration.
- Connect to SFTP, FTP, SMB, and WebDAV servers, discover disk shares when an SMB connection omits the share name, create remote files and folders, upload Android documents, and download remote files or directories to Android's Downloads folder with visible transfer progress.
- Open WebDAV documents, audio, and video in registered Android applications without staging a complete local copy when the server supports byte ranges. If the server cannot provide the ranges required for seeking, Voyager offers an explicit Download or Cancel choice. Other remote protocols continue to download files before opening them.
- Navigate file lists and grids with focus-aware Android TV remote controls, including select and long-press actions and keyboard-operable protocol selection.
- Authenticate to SFTP with a password, keyboard-interactive authentication, a private key file, or an in-app generated key pair whose public key can be copied or saved.
- Choose from 20 included color schemes, including AMOLED black and high-contrast options, with Material You dynamic colors on Android 12 and later.

Network connections are user-initiated. The app contains no analytics or tracking, and local browsing needs no network access.

## Storage and security

Settings offers an explicitly confirmed root session for devices with a compatible, authorized `su` manager. Root sessions can browse `/` and perform file operations; tapping a regular file opens a UTF-8 text editor limited to 256 KiB. Saves recheck the original before replacement, and root deletions require permanent-delete confirmation. Ordinary local browsing never requests root. Successful superuser operations have been tested in an isolated Linux fixture; rooted Android operation remains unverified. See [root verification coverage](docs/TESTING.md#protocol-integration-tests).

Full local browsing uses Android's all-files special access. If that access is denied, Voyager remains usable for document trees and remote servers. The Home and Settings screens explain the active access mode and provide a route back to Android's permission settings.

Saved remote passwords are encrypted with AES-GCM using a device-bound Android Keystore key. The connection database, settings, generated SSH keys, and SFTP known-host data are excluded from Android cloud backup and device transfer. SFTP uses trust on first use and rejects a server whose saved host key changes. The connection editor displays saved fingerprints and lets you forget the key for that exact host and port after confirmation; verify a replacement fingerprint through a trusted channel before reconnecting.

Generated SFTP private keys remain in app-private storage. Voyager displays the corresponding OpenSSH public key and provides Copy and Save actions so it can be installed on a server without exposing the private key.

SFTP and HTTPS WebDAV provide transport encryption. FTP is unencrypted, HTTP WebDAV is unencrypted, and Voyager negotiates SMB encryption, including with servers that require it, while retaining SMB2 compatibility; the connection editor warns before saving cleartext FTP or HTTP WebDAV. Use unencrypted protocols only on an isolated trusted network.

HTTPS WebDAV follows Android's system and user-installed certificate authorities. A private authority must be installed by the device owner, and normal certificate-chain and hostname validation still apply.

Direct WebDAV opening exposes an opaque, expiring `content` URI to the selected application. The URI contains no server address, remote path, username, or password. Voyager's playback provider is not exported and grants read access only to the launched handler.

## Requirements

- Android 8.0 (API 26) or later.
- A compatible server for remote browsing features.

## Install

- **F-Droid:** install from [f-droid.org/packages/com.voyagerfiles](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.voyagerfiles/).
- **GitHub:** download the latest `voyager-v<version>-universal.apk` or a matching per-ABI APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AlanHuang99/Voyager/releases/latest).

## Build from source

Prerequisites are JDK 17 and an Android SDK with compile SDK 35.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlanHuang99/Voyager.git
cd Voyager
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Debug APKs are written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. The debug application ID is `com.voyagerfiles.debug`, so it can coexist with a release installation.

Run the complete local gate before submitting a change:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug assembleRelease
```
